    <h1>Day2 with RYAZ</h1>
    <h3>My today's SOD is</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Updating Flip Animation in Countdown Timer</li>
      <li>Learn about EsLint and use it in Countdown Timer</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Progress</h3>
    <ol class="progress">
      <li>I started at 5:20 AM and my animation part is left for the Countdown Timer app.</li>
      <li>I spent a lot of time on it, for building the Countdown timer rather than just <strong>Copy Pasting</strong>.</li>
      <li>I understand the logic behind it and started designing it. I worked till 7:30, then I took a break.</li>
      <li>At 12:30 PM, I started again. I encountered many errors and difficulties building that design, but it increased my hands-on CSS skills.</li>
      <li>I worked on it consistently till 6 PM, taking a 30-minute break in between.</li>
      <li>I started working again at 8:00 AM and this time I finalized my website till 9:30 PM.</li>
      <li>Then I moved on to Eslint and learned:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>How to install it</li>
        <li>How to configure it</li>
        <li>How to use popular style guides</li>
      </ul>
      <li>I explored it till 11:00 PM.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="eod">
      <h3>EOD</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Finished Countdown Timer App.</li>
        <li>Installed ESLint.</li>
        <li>Learned how to use it and configure it.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>I worked for 11 hours today exploring and building with Riaz with styles.</p>
